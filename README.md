# Intent-Driven Template

An [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec) template with the `proposal -> specs -> design -> adr -> tasks` workflow enabled, plus optional collaboration workflows for teams that choose to adopt them. It works with both [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) and [Command Code](https://commandcode.ai/).

## How To Use This Template

### Start A New Project From This Template

Clone this repository, open it with OpenCode or Command Code, and start working
from the bundled OpenSpec configuration, commands, skills, and schema.

### Add This Template To An Existing Project

Open your existing project with OpenCode (or Command Code) and ask it to install the template:

```text
Read and understand https://raw.githubusercontent.com/intent-driven-dev/intent-driven-template/refs/heads/main/INSTALL_TEMPLATE.md and follow the instructions there.
```

Command Code discovers the same OpenSpec workflow through its native
`.commandcode/` directory (skills, commands, and agents), and also loads the
shared skills under `.agents/skills/`.

## What This Template Uses

- OpenSpec for setup, proposal, specification, design, ADR, and task artifacts.
- Custom schemas from https://github.com/intent-driven-dev/openspec-schemas.
- A bundled local copy of the `intent-driven` custom schema from
  https://github.com/intent-driven-dev/openspec-schemas/tree/main/openspec/schemas/intent-driven
  for the full `proposal -> specs -> design -> adr -> tasks` lifecycle.
- OpenSpec git discipline so proposals land on `main` before apply, and
  implementation lands on `main` before archive.
- OpenCode skills for repeatable collaboration and implementation workflows,
  including C4 diagrams, ADR authoring, and OpenSpec lifecycle commands.
- Superpowers from https://github.com/obra/superpowers for guided practices such
  as brainstorming, planning, debugging, verification, worktrees, and
  subagent-driven parallel work.
- Superpowers can be disabled by removing the `superpowers@git+https://github.com/obra/superpowers.git`
  entry from the `plugin` array in `opencode.json`, then restarting OpenCode.
- A bundled `test-driven-development` skill plus `senior-dev` and `senior-qa`
  subagents in `.opencode/agent/` for test-first implementation and
  acceptance-test work, routed via the `context` block in `openspec/config.yaml`.
- A `grill-me` style of rigorous design interrogation, inspired by
  https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/blob/main/skills/productivity/grill-me/SKILL.md.
- ADRs for durable architectural decisions.
- C4 diagrams for communicating architecture boundaries and relationships.
- Gherkin-style requirements and scenarios for observable behaviour.

The bundled OpenSpec schema is a local copy of the `intent-driven` schema from
https://github.com/intent-driven-dev/openspec-schemas/tree/main/openspec/schemas/intent-driven.

## Workflow

The intent-driven workflow moves through these artifacts in order:

```text
proposal -> specs -> design -> adr -> tasks
```

- `proposal` captures why the change matters.
- `specs` describe observable behaviour with Gherkin-style scenarios.
- `design` explains the implementation approach and trade-offs.
- `adr` records durable architectural decisions.
- `tasks` turn the accepted intent, behaviour, design, and decisions into work.

## Schema

`openspec/config.yaml` already selects the bundled [`intent-driven` schema](openspec/schemas/intent-driven/schema.yaml). Learn how to tailor artifact workflows in [OpenSpec Custom Schemas](https://intent-driven.dev/blog/2026/02/12/openspec-custom-schemas/).

## Skills

Standard OpenSpec lifecycle skills in `.opencode/skills/` — names are self-explanatory:
`openspec-new-change`, `openspec-propose`, `openspec-continue-change`, `openspec-explore`,
`openspec-apply-change`, `openspec-verify-change`, `openspec-sync-specs`, `openspec-archive-change`

The same OpenSpec lifecycle skills are mirrored in `.commandcode/skills/` for Command Code, with tool names adapted to Command Code's native tools.

| Skill | Location | Purpose | Enabled Or Updated By |
|-------|----------|---------|-----------------------|
| `openspec-bulk-apply-change` | `.opencode/skills/` | Applies multiple active changes concurrently in isolated worktrees with parallel verification. | Invoke directly with `/opsx:bulk-apply` command when applying multiple active openspec changes. |
| `adversarial-authoring` | `.opencode/skills/` | Runs author and reviewer agents in sequence to reduce model bias in drafts. | Refer to the skill under rule in the rules section of `openspec/config.yaml`. |
| `grill-me` | `.agents/skills/` | Interrogates plans and designs with probing questions to surface hidden assumptions. | Refer to this skill under rules section in `openspec/config.yaml`. |
| `c4-diagrams` | `.agents/skills/` | Visualises system architecture using C4 model levels in ASCII or Mermaid. | Refer to this skill under `design` rule in `openspec/config.yaml`. |
| `architectural-decision-records` | `.agents/skills/` | Captures architectural decisions with rationale, tradeoffs, and supersession chains. | Automatically invoked or can be explicilty referred to under `adr` rule in `openspec/config.yaml`. |
| `gherkin-authoring` | `.agents/skills/` | Drafts and improves Gherkin scenarios for observable, domain-language behaviour. | Required by `spec-as-source` during the `specs` phase. |
| `glossary` | `.agents/skills/` | Maintains business and technical terminology and companion glossary references for specification artifacts. | Can be referred to under `proposal` and/or `design` rule in `openspec/config.yaml`. |
| `openspec-git-discipline` | `.agents/skills/` | Enforces that proposals reach `main` before apply, and implementation merges before archive. | Enabled through `AGENTS.md`. |
| `spec-as-source` | `.agents/skills/` | Adds executable acceptance specifications to the intent-driven workflow. | Explicitly opt in by uncommenting both the `specs` and `tasks` rules in `openspec/config.yaml`. |
| `acceptance-test-authoring` | `.agents/skills/` | Configures the acceptance runner, extraction, linting, and step definitions for `spec-as-source`. | Required by `spec-as-source` when configuring or changing acceptance-test infrastructure. |
| `test-driven-development` | `.agents/skills/` | Guides strict red-green-refactor TDD: one behaviour per test, minimal implementation to pass, refactoring on green, with best-practice patterns and collaborator mocking guidance. | Loaded by the `senior-dev` agent in `.opencode/agent/senior-dev.md`; enable by uncommenting the `context` lines in `openspec/config.yaml` that route src work to `senior-dev`. |

Example configurations are available in `openspec/config.yaml` and `AGENTS.md`. You can comment/uncomment the skill references to enable them.

## Experimental: Spec As Source

The `spec-as-source` skill is an opt-in layer on the intent-driven schema that uses fenced Gherkin in OpenSpec specifications as the source for generating acceptance tests. To enable `spec-as-source` capability add the skill reference under both the `specs` and `tasks` rules in `openspec/config.yaml`.

During `specs`, `spec-as-source` requires `gherkin-authoring` to author the fenced Gherkin scenarios. During `tasks`, it replaces the standard task template with acceptance-test-first work: configure and run the acceptance suite, then implement application work. Use `acceptance-test-authoring` to configure the runner, extraction, linting, and step definitions that execute the specifications.

## Agents

Specialist agents used within skills, in `.opencode/agent/`:

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `adversarial-author` | Writes an initial draft of a specification artifact or design document. |
| `adversarial-reviewer` | Reviews the author's draft with challenges and improvement suggestions. |
| `senior-dev` | Implements src work test-first through strict red-green-refactor, following the `test-driven-development` skill. |
| `senior-qa` | Authors acceptance tests, step definitions, and runner configuration, following the `acceptance-test-authoring` skill. |

The same agents are mirrored in `.commandcode/agents/` for Command Code, using Command Code's subagent frontmatter.
